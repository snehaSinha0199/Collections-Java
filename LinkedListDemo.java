 *Q1) Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
 * ArrayList:-
 * 1)there is dynamic memory allocation.
 * 2)T.C and S.C at worst case is O(n).
 * 3)ArrayList has get().
 * 4)if you want to perform Read operation very high then you should use ArrayList
 * 
 * LinkedList:-
 * 1)there is not predefined memory allocation.
 * 2)T.C and S.C at worst case is O(n).
 *   a)when we insert at starting element then T.C=O(1) and S.C=O(1).
 *   b)when we insert at last element then T.C=O(1) and S.C=O(1).
 *   c)when we insert at mid then T.C=O(1) and S.C=O(n).
 * 3)LinkedList has better performance than ArrayList becuase S.C. of LinkedList is O(1)
 *  whereas S.C of ArrayList is O(n).
 * 4)LinkedList has add().
 * 5)if you want to perform read operation 
 * 
 * Q2)Difference between vector and ArrayList?
 * VECTOR:-
 * 1.vector is thread-safe because all its methods is synchronised.
 * 2.vector is inherited by stack(LIFO).
 * 2.performance:-poor performance due to all its method is synchronized.
 * 
 * ArrayList:-
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Q3)Difference between Array and ArrayList?
 * Array:-
 * 1)the size is fixed.
 * 2)here we cant implement generic.
 * 3)Array can be multidimensional.
 * 4)it doesnt have default size.Its mandatory for us to provide size.
 * 5)Array has a length() method.
 * 
 * ArrayList:-
 * 1)size is not fixed.
 * 2)here it allows generic.
 * 3)ArrayList is always single dimension.
 * 4)Default size of ArrayList is 10.
 * 5)ArrayList has a size() method.
